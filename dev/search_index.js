Using the interface of introduced in this package, you can query n, evaluate the log density and optionally its gradient, and determine if a particular object supports these methods using traits. This usage is relevant primarily for package developers who write generic algorithms that use (log) densities that correspond to posteriors and likelihoods, eg MCMC, MAP, ML. An example is DynamicHMC.jl. This is documented in the API section.\nMake it easier for users who want to perform inference using the above methods (and packages) to\ndefine their own log densities, either taking a vector of real numbers as input, or extracting and transforming parameters using the TransformVariables.jl package,\nobtain gradients of these log densities using one of the supported automatic differentiation packages of Julia.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"This is documented in the next section, with a worked example.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"For the purposes of this package, log densities are still valid when shifted by a constant that may be unknown, but is consistent within calls.
