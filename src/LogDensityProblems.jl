"""
A unified interface for log density problems, for

1. defining mappings to a log density (eg Bayesian for inference),

2. optionally obtaining a gradient using automatic differentiation,

3. defining a common interface for working with such log densities and gradients (eg MCMC).

These use cases utilize different parts of this package, make sure you read the
documentation.

$(TYPEDEF)

A trait that means that a log density supports evaluating derivatives up to order `K`.

Typical values for `K` are `0` (just the log density) and `1` (log density and gradient).

$(SIGNATURES)

Test if the type (or a value, for convenience) supports the log density interface.

When `nothing` is returned, it doesn't support this interface.  When `LogDensityOrder{K}()`
is returned (typically with `K == 0` or `K = 1`), derivatives up to order `K` are supported.
*All other return values are invalid*.

# Interface description

The following methods need to be implemented for the interface:

1. [`dimension`](@ref) returns the *dimension* of the domain,

2. [`logdensity`](@ref) evaluates the log density at a given point.

3. [`logdensity_and_gradient`](@ref) when `K ≥ 1`.

See also [`LogDensityProblems.stresstest`](@ref) for stress testing.

    dimension(ℓ)

Dimension of the input vectors `x` for log density `ℓ`. See [`logdensity`](@ref),
[`logdensity_and_gradient`](@ref).

!!! note
    This function is *distinct* from `TransformedVariables.dimension`.
"""
function dimension end

"""
    logdensity(ℓ, x)

Evaluate the log density `ℓ` at `x`, which has length compatible with its
[`dimension`](@ref).

Return a real number, which may or may not be finite (can also be `NaN`). Non-finite values
other than `-Inf` are invalid but do not error, caller should deal with these appropriately.

# Note about constants

Log densities can be shifted by *the same constant*, as long as it is consistent between
calls. For example,

```julia
logdensity(::StandardMultivariateNormal) = -0.5 * sum(abs2, x)
```

is a valid implementation for some callable `StandardMultivariateNormal` that would
implement the standard multivariate normal distribution (dimension ``k``) with pdf
```math
(2\\pi)^{-k/2} e^{-x'x/2}
```
"""
function logdensity end

"""
    logdensity_and_gradient(ℓ, x)

Evaluate the log density `ℓ` and its gradient at `x`, which has length compatible with its
[`dimension`](@ref).

Return two values:

- the log density as real number, which equivalent to `logdensity(ℓ, x)`

- *if* the log density is finite, the gradient, an `::AbstractVector` of real numbers,
   otherwise this value is arbitrary and should be ignored.

!!! note
    Caller may assume ownership of results, ie that the gradient vector will not be
    overwritten or reused for a different purpose.

The first argument (the log density) can be shifted by a constant, see the note for
[`logdensity`](@ref).

##### Transformed log density (typically Bayesian inference)

"""
    TransformedLogDensity(transformation, log_density_function)

A problem in Bayesian inference. Vectors of length compatible with the dimension (obtained
from `transformation`) are transformed into a general object `θ` (unrestricted type, but a
named tuple is recommended for clean code), correcting for the log Jacobian determinant of
the transformation.

`log_density_function(θ)` is expected to return *real numbers*. For zero densities or
infeasible `θ`s, `-Inf` or similar should be returned, but for efficiency of inference most
methods recommend using `transformation` to avoid this. It is recommended that
`log_density_function` is a callable object that also encapsulates the data for the problem.

Use the property accessors `ℓ.transformation` and `ℓ.log_density_function` to access the
arguments of `ℓ::TransformedLogDensity`, these are part of the public API.

# Usage note

This is the most convenient way to define log densities, as `capabilities`, `logdensity`,
and `dimension` are automatically defined. To obtain a type that supports derivatives, use
[`ADgradient`](@ref).

Wrap `P` using automatic differentiation to obtain a gradient.

Some methods may be loaded only conditionally after the relevant package is loaded (eg
`using Zygote`).

The symbol can also be used directly as eg

```julia

The function `parent` can be used to retrieve the original argument.
